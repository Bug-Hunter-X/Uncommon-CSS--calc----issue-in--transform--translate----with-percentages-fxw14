The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where the use of `calc()` with percentages within a `transform: translate()` property can lead to unexpected results when applied to an element with a specified width.

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  transform: translateX(calc(50% - 25px));
}
```

The intention is to shift the div 25 pixels to the left from its center. However, `calc()` evaluates the percentage *after* the `transform` is applied, leading to inconsistent results.
