The solution avoids using `calc()` within the `translate()` property when working with percentages. A more reliable method is to directly set the `left` property to achieve the desired horizontal shift.

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  left: 25%;
  position: relative;
}
```

Alternatively, if absolute positioning isn't suitable, using `margin` can provide a solution.  For example, moving the element 25 pixels to the left can be achieved with:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: -25px; 
}
```

This way avoids the ambiguity of `calc()` within the transformation and yields a consistent result.
